# Lima  Creative Portfolio Website 🎨✨

Welcome to my final project for the HTML/CSS course – a personal portfolio website designed with creativity, code, and care! 💻🌸

---

## 🎯 Theme / Inspiration

The design is inspired by a soft and modern aesthetic, combining light pastel colors with a clean layout to reflect my personal style. I wanted the site to feel peaceful, elegant, and creative — just like me!

## 🎨 Design Decisions

- 🎨 Color Scheme: A pastel pink and lavender theme to evoke calmness and friendliness.
- 🔤 Typography: Two custom fonts from Google Fonts were used for a modern and personal feel.
- 📱 Responsive Layout: Flexbox and media queries were used to make the site look great on all screen sizes.
- 🎨 Custom Illustration: A digital drawing of a girl was added to the About page to express personality and creativity.
- 💫 CSS Effects: Hover transitions and subtle animations are used to make the site more interactive and elegant.

## 🧩 Challenges

- Making the layout responsive without using JavaScript.
- Positioning the image properly next to the biography text in different screen sizes.
- Choosing fonts and colors that feel creative but are also accessible and readable.
